# sql-challenge
The instructions for this challenge had me create and query data in a SQL Server. I was also tasked with creating a entity relationship diagram before creating the SQL tables as a way to structure my server. As a challenge, I was supposed to access this server using python. I have included all of the relavent documents and data in the main folder.
